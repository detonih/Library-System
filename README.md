# Library System
Initially this project was created just for trying Sequelize. However, as the work progressed, I decided to turn it into something better and test some of my skills developed during my learning.
Thus, I have decided to create a Library System because it have some attributes that can I build up in many layers of applications.
Exemples of this is a good associations between several entities.
Wait for more details.
